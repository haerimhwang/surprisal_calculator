  Compute surprisal from language models!


  surprisal supports most Causal Language Models
  (GPT2- and GPTneo-like models) from Huggingface or
  local checkpoint, as well as GPT3 models from
  OpenAI using their API!


  Masked Language Models (BERT-like models) are in
  the pipeline and will be supported at a future
  time.
